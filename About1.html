			<p><b>A</b>s you start a new academic year, take advantage of the many services available to help you achieve your full potential. The Center for Academic Success offers many programs to keep you on the road to graduation and professional success, such as tutoring and workshops on improving time management, note-taking and test preparation. Remember that the Library and Career Services are here to help, whether you are an online or on-site student.

                I encourage you to get involved, to participate in student government, and to take part in the array of opportunities and initiatives hosted by Student Development and Campus Life throughout the year. During the year, you can also join me for a Chat and Chew session â€“ an opportunity for me to learn more about you, your plans for your future, and to answer your questions.
                
                Supporting you is central to our mission at Berkeley College. We are here to guide you as you become the best version of yourself.
                
                Remember to make it a great year. I will see you soon..</p>
